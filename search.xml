(Human-Machine Interface)</li><li><strong>Returns</strong>: the <strong>return of trajectory</strong> is the <strong>sum of rewards</strong> collected along the trajectory. (Also known as <em>Total rewards or cumulative reward</em>). Returns consists <em><strong>immediate reward</strong></em> and <em><strong>future reward</strong></em>.</li><li><strong>Discounted Returns</strong>: A discounted factor is applied for infinitely long trajectories. It can also <strong>adjust the emphasis on near- or far-future rewards</strong>.</li><li><strong>Policies</strong>: Policy (<strong>stochastic</strong> in general, but sometimes <strong>deterministic</strong>) tells the agent which actions to take at every state, which can be denoted as arrow.</li><li><strong>Trajectory</strong>: a state-action-reward chain. $s_1 \xrightarrow[r&#x3D;0]{a_2} s_2   \xrightarrow[r&#x3D;0]{a_3} s_5   \xrightarrow[r&#x3D;0]{a_3} s_8   \xrightarrow[r&#x3D;1]{a_2} s_9 .$ There is <em><strong>infinite-length(horizon) trajectory</strong></em> except for <em><strong>finite trajectory</strong></em>. So for <em><strong>finite returns</strong></em> and <em><strong>infinite reward.</strong></em></li><li><strong>Immediate Rewards</strong>: reward obtained after taking an action at the initial state.</li><li><strong>Future Rewards</strong>: reward obtained after leaving the initial state.</li><li><strong>Episodes</strong>: a finite trajectory with terminal states whose result trajectory is an episode.</li><li><strong>episodic task&#x2F;continuing task</strong>: whether terminal states exist. The episodic tasks can be mathematically converted to continuing tasks by defining the processes after reaching terminal states.</li><li><strong>visit</strong>: every time a state-action pair appears in an episode, it is called a <em><strong>visit</strong></em> of <strong>state-action pair</strong>.</li><li><strong>Behavior Policy</strong>: it is used to generate experience samples.</li><li><strong>Target Policy</strong>: it is constantly updated to converge to an optimal policy.</li><li><strong>On-policy</strong>: When the <strong>behavior policy</strong> is equal to the <strong>target policy</strong>.</li><li><strong>Off-policy</strong>: When the <strong>behavior policy</strong> is different from the <strong>target policy</strong>. off-policy learning can learn optimal policies based on the experience samples generated by other policies.</li><li><strong>Experience replay:</strong> *The draw of samples is called <em><em>experience replay, which should follow a uniform distribution.</em> The main function of experience replay is to break the correlation of a sequence of action-state pairs. A</em>*fter we have collected some experience samples, we do not use these samples in the order they were collected. They are stored at the <strong>replay buffer</strong>. $(s, a, r, s’)$ is the experience sample and $\mathcal{B}&#x3D; {(s, a, r, s’)}$ is the replay buffer. every time updating the network we will draw a mini-batch from the <strong>replay buffer</strong>.</li></ul><p>Two ways to express <strong>State Transition</strong>:</p><ol><li>Table (<strong>only</strong> <strong>deterministic state transition</strong>)</li></ol><p><img src="/RL1/figure1.png" alt="figure1.png"></p><ol><li><p>Probability Expression</p><p> <img src="/RL1/figure2.png" alt="figure2.png"></p></li></ol><h3 id="Policy-Evaluation"><a href="#Policy-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Policy Evaluation"></a>Policy Evaluation</h3><p>Since the state value can be used to evaluate a policy, solving the state values from the Bellman Equation is <em><strong>policy evaluation</strong></em>.</p>]]></content>
